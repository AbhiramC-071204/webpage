       <p class="home-p"> K. Rishi Kumar is announced as the chief executive officer of Origin, a flourishing company based in United States of America. He brings his mother from India to stay with him. Nidhi, his colleague organises a party to surprise him, which would be attended by his close childhood friend Kanna, who had not met him for a few years, professor Chandrashekar and college friends. The story flashes back.

        Seven years ago, Rishi belonged to a middle-class nuclear family in Hyderabad; his father Satyanarayana, a clerk in a private corporation incurred debts as a result of his low earnings whose 'failure' caused Rishi to be not on good terms with him. Rishi secured admission to complete his post-graduation in IIET, an esteemed university situated in Vizag, and hence had to move. Rishi, his roommate Ravi Shankar, and Pooja, all of them being classmates became best friends. </p>
